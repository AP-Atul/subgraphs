# Mapping

This document contains some information about issues you may run into, or tips and tricks that may help you when working on mappings.

## Best Practice

### Indexing Speed

There are couple things you can do to significantly improve your indexing speed:

- Set a startblock (Use the deployment block of the contracts).
- Avoid call handlers and block handlers. Also depending on the Ethereum node ran by an indexer, call handlers and block handlers may or may not be supported (esp. on alt-EVM chains).
- Limit the number of contract calls you perform. If you do need to perform contract calls, save the data, so you won't have to do repeated calls.

## Common Issues

### Proxy

Some protocols use proxy contracts for upgradeability. Note that when handling proxy contracts, you should use the ABI of the implementation contract instead of the proxy contract. For example, Aave v2 uses a proxy for its Lending Pool contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9#code

You should navigate to the implementation contract first (Contract -> Read as Proxy -> Address underlined in red) and use the ABI there:

### Price Oracles

### Snapshots

If no event occurred throughout the duration of a snapshot, you can skip that snapshot.

## Testing

### Matchstick

You can leverage the Matchstick unit testing framework to better debug/test your code:

## Debugging

### Debug Logs

One of the most useful tools to debug is the `log` function in `@graphprotocol/graph-ts`. You can use it like follows in your mapping code:

```
log.debug('[Test Log] arbitrary argument {}', [123]);
```

which will show up in the Logs tab of Subgraph Studio:

![Debug Logs](images/logs.png "Debug Logs")

You also have an option of `Error`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Debug` as the log level. I like to use `Warning` so that I can quickly filter for it. The way to filter for logs of a specific level is to click (uncheck) the log levels circled in red above.

### Indexing Status

You can check the indexing status of your subgraph and surface indexing errors that you may encounter along the way here: https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/quick-start/#5-check-your-logs

**Note**: you should use (copy/paste) this endpoint when you use the GraphiQL playground: https://api.thegraph.com/index-node/graphql. If you click into it, it's going to direct you to a different URL which won't work with the GraphiQL playground.

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues with subgraph tooling that you may run into:

- Using a `derivedFrom` field in the graph code gives no compile time issues but fails when the graph syncs with error `unexpected null	wasm` ([Github Issue](https://iboxshare.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts/issues/219))
